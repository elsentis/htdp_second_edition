; Q.:
; Design the cham program, which has the chameleon continuously walking across the canvas from left to right.
; When it reaches the right end of the canvas, it disappears and immediately reappears on the left
; For managing the chameleonâ€™s happiness gauge, you may reuse the happiness gauge from the virtual cat
