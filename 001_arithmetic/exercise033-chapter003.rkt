; Q.:
; Research the “year 2000” problem.

; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem
; The year 2000 problem, also commonly known as Y2K problem, Y2K scare, millennium bug, Y2K bug, Y2K glitch, Y2K error,
; or simply Y2K refers to potential computer errors related to the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates in
; and after the year 2000. Many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits, making the year 2000
; indistinguishable from 1900. Computer systems' inability to distinguish dates correctly had the potential to bring down
; worldwide infrastructures for computer reliant industries.

; In the years leading up to the turn of the century (millennium), the public gradually became aware of the "Y2K scare",
; and individual companies predicted the global damage caused by the bug would require anything between
; $400 million and $600 billion to rectify. A lack of clarity regarding the potential dangers of the bug led some to stock up
; on food, water, and firearms, purchase backup generators, and withdraw large sums of money in anticipation
; of a computer-induced apocalypse.[2]

; Contrary to published expectations, few major errors occurred in 2000. Supporters of the Y2K remediation effort argued that
; this was primarily due to the pre-emptive action of many computer programmers and information technology experts.
; Companies and organizations in some countries, but not all, had checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to
; address the problem. Then-U.S. president Bill Clinton, who organized efforts to minimize the damage in the United States,
; labeled Y2K as "the first challenge of the 21st century successfully met",
; and retrospectives on the event typically commend the programmers who worked to avert the anticipated disaster.
