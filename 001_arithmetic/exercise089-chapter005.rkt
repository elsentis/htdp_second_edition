; Q.:
; Design the happy-cat world program, which manages a walking cat and its happiness level.
; Letâ€™s assume that the cat starts out with perfect happiness.

(define WIDTH  1000)
(define CAT-SCENE_HEIGHT 200)
(define H-GAUGE_HEIGHT 20)

(define cat1 (bitmap/file "./images/cat1.png"))
(define cat2 (bitmap/file "./images/cat2.png"))

(define CAT-Y-LEVEL (- HEIGHT (/ (image-height cat1) 2) 1))
(define CAT-X-INCREASE-PER-TOCK (/ WIDTH 300))

(define H-LOW-LIMIT 0)
