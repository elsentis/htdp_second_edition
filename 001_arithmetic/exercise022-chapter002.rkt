; Q.:
; Use DrRacketâ€™s stepper on this program fragment, Does the explanation match your intuition?

(define (distance-to-origin x y)
  (sqrt (+ (sqr x) (sqr y))))

(distance-to-origin 3 4)


; Q.:
; Does the explanation match your intuition?

; Yes, the stepper shows the substitution of arguments in the body of the main function
; and the sequential use of all auxiliary functions
