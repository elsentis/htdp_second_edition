; Q.:
; Design the function cat, which consumes a list of strings and appends them all into one long string
; Guess a function that can create the desired result from the values computed by the sub-expressions.



; A List-of-strings is one of: 
; – '()
; – (cons String List-of-strings)
; interpretation - a list of some strings


; List-of-string -> String
; concatenates all strings in l into one long string

    [(empty? l) ""]
