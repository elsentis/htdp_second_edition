; Q.:
; Take a look at this attempt to solve exercise 17
; Does stepping through an application suggest a fix?

(define (image-classify img)
  (cond
    [(>= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "tall"]
    [(= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "square"]
    [(<= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "wide"]))


(image-classify (rectangle 10 10 "outline" "red"))

; condition of equal sides to check "tall" and "wide" is wrong
; condition of equal sides only needed for "square" check
