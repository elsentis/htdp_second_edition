; Q.:
; Here is another way to represent bouncing balls
; Interpret this code fragment and create other instances of balld.


(define SPEED 3)

(define-struct balld [location direction])
; interp. a balld is interpretation of ball, with
; location is distance from top of the canvas
; and dire—Åtion of the ball movement relative to the top of the canvas


(define bal-1 (make-balld 10 "up"))
(define bal-2 (make-balld 0 "down"))
(define bal-3 (make-balld 50 "up"))
