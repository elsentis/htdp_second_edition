; Q.:
; Define a structure type that keeps track of the catâ€™s x-coordinate and its happiness.
; Then formulate a data definition for cats, dubbed VCat, including an interpretation.

; H is a Number between [0..100].
; interpretation represents a happiness value

; X-coord is a Number
; interpretation represents a object location coordinate


(define-struct vcat (x hap))
;; A VCat is a structure:
;;   (make-vcat Image Track)
;; interp. a virtual cat, including 
;;         information about its movement and happiness and path direction
;;         x is the X-coord of the cat on the screen
;;         hap is its happiness H
